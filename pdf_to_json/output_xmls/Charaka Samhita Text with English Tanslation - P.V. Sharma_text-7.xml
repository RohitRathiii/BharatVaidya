Even much heavy food is not able to pacify the fire kindled by fat. ( Hence ) one passing undigested diarrhoeic stools due to deficient agni should take adequate dose of ghrta mixed with appetising drugs. By this the samana vayu being normalised and positioned in its normal passage and due to its movement nearby improves the power of agni quickly. One who passes stool with difficulty due to hardness should take ghee in ample quantity added with salt amid meal. If agni is deficient due to roughness, one should take ghee or oil mixed with appetisers. In case of deficiency of fire due to excessive unction ( intake of fat ), powders, arisjas and dsavas are wholesome. If there is diarrhoea due to coating in the ano-rectum, oil, sura and dsava are beneficial. If agni is deficient due to udavarta ( upward movement of vayu ), non-unctuous and unctuous enema are adininistered.</p><p>In case the agni is deficient due to aggravation of dogsas, one should first be evacuated and then subjected to the therapeutic measures for the concerned doga.</p><p>During the period of convalescence the deficient fire should be stimulated by ghee.</p><p>If the fire is deficient due to fasting, it should be stimulated by taking ghee with gruels. Ghee taken in the midst of meal is promoter of strength, appetite and body weight. The patients who are debilitated, wasted and emaciated due to chronicity of the disease should be given light diet with the soured meat-soups of the animals of prey or carnivorous animals, They stimulate the agni quickly due to intense, hot and evacuating properties and promote the body weight more quickly because of their meat having been nourished by flesh. The digestive fire is stimulated by neither fasting nor over-eating like without fuel or little fire covered with excessive fuel. The power of digestive fire increases with the intake of unctuous food, various powders, aristas, sura, asavas prescribed properly by the physician. As fire with ( the fuel of ) heartwood is stable and lasts for long, the internal fire is stabilised by the application of unctuous food. One enjoys health for long by taking wholesome dict in proper quantity and after the previous food is digested. One should be caref ul to promote the agni by disturbing the equilibrium of dhatus. When dogas are in equilibrium the heat of agni located in the midportion of the body is also normal and the food digested by it Icads to promotion of health, corpulence, life-span and strength, If agni becomes deficient or excessive duc to imbalanced dosas, it causes disorders. The details about the deficient fire have already been said, now the excessive fire will be described. <ref type="bibr">[211]</ref><ref type="bibr">[212]</ref><ref type="bibr">[213]</ref><ref type="bibr">[214]</ref><ref type="bibr">[215]</ref><ref type="bibr">[216]</ref>  In the person having diminished kapha, the aggravated pitta following the vayu strenghtens the fire in its seat ( grahami ) by its intrinsic heat. Then the fire getting intensely powerful along with vayu in the person excessively roughened digests the food forcibly, quickly and frequently due to intensity. After «ligesting the food, it also digests the dhatus like blood etc. resulting in debility, disorders and finally death of the person. The patient aflected by excessive fire gets relief from food but becomes restless soon after it is digested. Thirst, dyspnoea, burning, fainting etc. are the disorders due to excessive fire.</p><p>Such excessive fire should be pacified by administering heavy, unctuous, cold, , sweet and slimy food and drinks like fire by pouring water. Even on indigestion / he should be fed frequently so that agni without fuel may not get opportunity to | kill him. The patient should cat rice cooked in milk, rice cooked with pulse, fatty | and floury preparations, products of jaggery, fatty meat of aquatic and marshy animals. One should eat fishes particularly smooth and moving in still water and fatty mutton which destroys the exccessive fire. While hungry he should take gruel mixed with beewax or drink ghee. Or after venesection he shoul take churned drink of wheatflour or milk boiled with sugar, ghee and vitaliser drugs. }</p><p>The bolus of powdered oily fruits added with sugar and fatty meat soup; make the fire mild. The patient should drink ghee mixed with beewax followed by | cold water or wheat flour mixed with ghee followed by milk. Or he should take three fats ( except oil ) processed with the meat Juice of marshy animals or solid { | | preparations made of fine wheat fiour mixed with (the above ) three fats with .</p><p>] milk. For pacifying the excessive fire, one should take bark of udum-| bara with woman?s breast milk or payasa ( rice cooked with milk ) | prepared with these two. The patient should be subjected to frequent purgation i | with milk boiled with syama and trivrt for eliminating the excess of pitta giving the ) diet of rice cookeu with milk. The wise physician considering all the aspects should | administer tne above measures.</p><p>Whatever food is sweet, fatty, kapha-aggravating and heavy is entirely | wholesome for the patient of excessive fire along with day-sleep after meal. The | patient who without going into fainting takes fatty diet in excessive fire does not fall a prey to the possible disorders, on the contrary, attains corpulence. When || kapha is increased, pitta along witl. vayu is overcome, the normalised fire in onc having balanced dhatus digests the food leading to promotion of corpulence, |ifespan and strength. <ref type="bibr">[217]</ref><ref type="bibr">[218]</ref><ref type="bibr">[219]</ref><ref type="bibr">[220]</ref><ref type="bibr">[221]</ref><ref type="bibr">[222]</ref><ref type="bibr">[223]</ref><ref type="bibr">[224]</ref><ref type="bibr">[225]</ref><ref type="bibr">[226]</ref><ref type="bibr">[227]</ref><ref type="bibr">[228]</ref><ref type="bibr">[229]</ref><ref type="bibr">[230]</ref><ref type="bibr">[231]</ref><ref type="bibr">[232]</ref><ref type="bibr">[233]</ref><ref type="bibr">[234]</ref>  Eating wholesome and unwholesome items mixed together is known as ?samasgana?. Eating more or less, or before or after the proper time is known as ?visamiSana?. Envting while the previous meal is still undigested is known as ?adhyagana?. These three ( samaSana, visamiSana and adhyagana ) cause death or severe disorders.</p><p>Even on indigestion of the day-meal the night-meal is not disturbing. ( The reason is )-during day heart is blossomei like lotus and because of this all channels remain clear. Moreover, due to physical exertion, movements and mental activities the dhatus do not get moistened during day, So on other food added to the unmoistened previous one does not get affected and becomes homogenous. like fresh milk mixed with the undamaged one. On the contrray, during night heart is faded, channels are covered and belly is obstructed and as such the dhdtus get moistened.</p><p>Another food added while the undigested material is moistened gets affected like hot milk added to the damaged milk. Hence the wise person in order to protect his strength and life-span should never eat anything if the food taken in night is still undigested, <ref type="bibr">[235]</ref><ref type="bibr">[236]</ref><ref type="bibr">[237]</ref><ref type="bibr">[238]</ref><ref type="bibr">[239]</ref><ref type="bibr">[240]</ref><ref type="bibr">[241]</ref><ref type="bibr">[242]</ref><ref type="bibr">[243]</ref> aa WA?

The patient of pinduroga who takes pitta-aggravating things excessively, his pitta burns blood and flesh and thus gives rise to the disorder. His eyes, skin, nails and face become deep yellow, faeces and urine as red and _ yellow and he looks like a frog. His senses and organs lose their functions and he is associated with burning sensation, indigestion, debility, malaise and anorexia. This is known as kamala ( jaundice ). It is due to aggravation of pitta and is known as located in kostha ( belly ) or Sakha ( blood etc. ), Kumbhakamala( jaundice located in belly ) being established firmly due to chronicity becomes curable with difficulty.</p><p>The patient of jaundice succumsbs soon to the disease if faeces and urine become black yellow, there are excessive swelling, blood in eyes, mouth, vomiting, faeces and urine, fainting, burning sensation, anorexia, thirst, hardness in bowels, drowsiness, confusion, loss of the power of digestion and consciousness, <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr">[38]</ref> araritatat 7 saeatr fafateeras au aT Tesartt Rarrweitestevalgatire: | erarregt dated atutent BAe g fata: iteoll OT oem reat eiaperstereat remreme are ere, eee, ene, ree tet qareatnaia sma cated: i aargrd fafd a catterrarata lt ue Il qared wartre wearoresadty atl ataars Ga qa ReTTTEge era tt V3 Now I will describe the treatment of the cases which are curable.</p><p>The patient of pinduroga after unction shouia be subjected to strong emesis and purgation while that of jaundice to mild purgation with bitter drugs.

This specific measure is desired because of the specific etiology. The patient who passes white stools like sesamum-paste indicates the obstruciio. to the passage of bile due to kapha. This should be relieved by eliminating kapha. Due to intake of rough, cold, heavy and sweet food, exertion and suppression of natural urges vayu vitiated and powerful and mixed with aggravated kapha throws pitta out of its own seat thus making the person with yellow eyes, urine and skin and white stools associated with gurgling sound and stillness in abdomen and heaviness in cardiac region. Due to diminution of pitta because of its sifting to blood circulation patient suffers gradually from ? debility, poor digestion, pain in sides, hiccup, dyspnoea, the anorexia and fever. When pitta has reverted to its place, stool is pigmented with bile ( recovered its normal yellowish colour ) and the complications are subsided the management said earlier in connection with jaundice stiould be adopted. In the chapter on enumeration of diseases ( Su. 19) each of them has been said as of five tyyes. Now listen about their etiology, symptoms and treatment.</p><p>These two diseases arise due to dust, smoke, wind, residing in cold place and and using cold water, physical exertion, sexual intercourse, travelling on foot, intake of rough food, irregular meals, vitiation of ama, distension of bowels, roughness, oversaturation, debility, injury to vital parts, use of duals (cold and hot etc. ) together and excessive evacuation and also (as complications ) in diseases such as diarrhoea, fever, vomiting, coryza, chest injury with wasting, internal haemorrhage, upward movement of vayu, viscika, alasaka, panduroga and poisoning. Besides they also arise, due to intake of nispava, black gram, oil cake, sesamum and oil, flour prepartions, tubers, distending, burning and heavy food, aquatic and marshy meat, curd, unboiled milk, channel-blocking regimens and use of kapha-aggravating things leading to obstruction in throat and chest and various other sorts of retention. When vata ordinarily pressed, by physical exercise moves from belly to throat, it produces ?ksudra hikka? (minor hiccup). ?This is not very troublesome, does nou afflict the vital parts of chest and does not obstruct the passage of respiration and food. ?It aggravates on physical exertion and subsides after meal in the same way as it starts, It is of mild nature and is located in heart, kloma, throat and palate. This is ksudra hikka which is curable. <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> ( Thus ksudra hikka ). In lying posture dyspnoea is aggravated and he can?t sleep because in that Position vayu seizes his sides of chest. He feels comfortable while sitting and welcomes hot things. His. eyes are elevated, forehead. perspiring; he has severe pain, dried mouth, and suffers frequently from paroxysms of dyspnoea which aggravates by clouds, water, cold, easterly wind and kapha-increasing things. This is tamaka Swasa ( bronchial asthma ) which can be maintained or can be cured if it is newly arisen. The ordinary vata in belly produced by rough articles and exertion moves upwards and causes ksudra $wisa (minor dyspnoea ). It is not so distressing for the body, does not affect the body parts, is not so troublesome as other ( types of dyspnoea ) nor does it restrict the normal course of food and drinks. It does not produce any discomfort or pain in senses.</p><p>In strong patients ksudra $wasa is curable and also the other types if they are not manitested fully. fet geamifs @ we quent! ste @ fraey aceafredtsfire: 1 9% I Both ( hikka and Swasa ) are? managed indentically due to their indentical etiology, location and root as observed by the sages, listen.</p><p>~fa XVII] CHIKITSASTHANAM</p></div>

By this his inspissated phlegm into the channels gets dissolved and thereby the passages become soft and vayu returns to its normal course. As on hilly forests the snow is liquified by the heat of sun-rays, the sticky phlegm in the body gets dissolved by the heat of sudation. After fullsudation the patient should be giventhe diet consisting of rice with uncting substance along with meat soup of fish or boar or with the supernatant fatty layer of curd.

In all cases, there is little and managable risk in administering promoting regimen, in pacifying measures also the risk is not too much whereas in lightening ( or reducing ) measures the risk is too much and unmanageable. Hence the patients of hiccup and dyspnoea evacuated or unevacuated, should be managed mostly with promotive and pacifying measures. Due to irregular meals, intake of unsuitable food, excessive sexual intercourse, suppression of-urges the three dosas get vitiated in the person already affected with disguit and anxiety and consequent loss of digestive power and produce kasa caused by wasting which further leads to wasting of the body, The patient expectorates foctid, grecn, red and pus-like sputum and feels while coughing as ifthe heart has fallen down from its normal place.

He is always envious and disgustful. He suffers from fever of mixed characters, pain in sides, coryza, anorexia, liquid or solid stocl and hoarseness of voice without an apparent cause. This iscough caused by wasting. It isfatal in wasted patients but is curable in strong ones. Likewise, cough due to chest wound is maintainable (:in strong persons ).
