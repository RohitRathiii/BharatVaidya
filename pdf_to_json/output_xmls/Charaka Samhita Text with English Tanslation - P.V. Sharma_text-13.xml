On the other hand, if the former is similar in potency, the effectivity of latter is enhanced. The six hundred formulations described here should be taken only as for guidance. One may, however, make thousands or crores of such formulations ly his own intellect. There is no limit to the number of formulations because of abun:lanee of drugs and their variations. The drug attains drasticity if it is uncontaminated with water, fire ant organisms, is endowed with properties on account of proper placc ant time, a:lministered in somewhat higher dose and impregnated with (the juice of ) drugs similar in potency and the patient is properly uncted and fomented.</p><p>The drug exerts medium action if it is somewhat devoid of the above qualitics and also in lower dose and the patient is properly uncted and fomented.

In mediu: 1 cooking, the final product is like samyava and does not adhere to laddle. When fin ?1 product disintegrates during wicking it is known as charred cooking. The person to be yomiicd should be excited ( with regard to impurity ) with the meat soup of domestic, aquatic an} marshy animals, black gram as well as milk.</p><p>Likewise, that to be purged should be excited after he is uncted with meat soup of wild animals an! vegetable soup which do not aggravate kapha. In case of excessive purgation, clisorders due to vata caused by diminutior of kapha, rakta and pitta such as numbness, body-ache, exhaustion, trembling etc., sleeplessness, debility, unconsciousness, insanity and hiccup arise. The diseases pertaining to extremities and bowels and also those arisen in vital parts, upper parts, general and localised parts have no cause other than vayu in their production.</p><p>As vayu is responsible for uisjunction and conjunction of faeces, urine, bile etc. with their recaptacles, there is no remedy other than enema for pacification when it is aggravated severely. Hence enema is said as half medicine or even whole medicine by some. When the head is properly evacuated lightness in chest and head, clarity of senses nnd cleanness of channels are observed.</p><p>If it is deficiently evacuated there are pasting in throat, heaviness in head and spitting.</p><p>In case of its excessive evacuation, there is distress and pain in head, eyes, temples and ears and the patient sees darkness.</p><p>The above case should be managed with mild saturating drop while the case of deficient evacuation should be treated with irritant drugs after unction. at gear wqRatvaeaa a aa! asi a artes aqaa dsagaa | 21 That in whom and why paficakarma should not be applied and in whom the same should be applied will be described entirely hereafter.

The tired, the thirsty and the hungry may be affected likewise. In cases of those affected by evacuative measures, loadcarryiny, and wayfaring and those indulged in fasting, coition, study, physical exercise and anxiety and those who are emaciated, there may pe risk of aggravation of vita, haemorrhage and wound due to roughness.

In that suffering from Urdhwavata and having undergone treatment with non-unctuous or unctuous enema there may be excessive movement of vayu.
