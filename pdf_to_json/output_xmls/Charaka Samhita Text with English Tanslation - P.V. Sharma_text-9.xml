When the bleeding is excessive, paste of cold drugs like vata etc. should be applied.

The darvikara snake is identified from hood, mandala one from coiled hood and rajiman from the body variegated with spots and streaks, Their poison is rough and pungent, sour and hot, and sweet and cold respectively and as such vitiate vata etc. The bite of darvikara has minute mark of fangs, is black, congested with blood, tortoise-like and produces vatika disorders, the bite of mandali has big mark of fangs, is swollen, yellowish or yellow-red and causes all sorts of paitiika disorders, The bite of rajiman is slimy, with stable swelling, unctuous, pale having viscous blood and causes disorders of kapha. The snake round-coiled, huge-bodied, with remarkable respiration, upward eyes, large head and even organs is male otherwise female.

This is similar to black snake. Besides, there are several other cross-breeds.</p><p>?The bite which is deeply performed, elevated, painful, placed lengthwise and having marks of fangs and inflammation is very troublesome while the other bites are not so much distressing. From faeces and urine of snakes themselves, insects arise which are of two kinds?disivisa (chronic poison) and pranahara (deadly poison). In bites of dusivisa insects, the part becomes red, white, black or blackish, covered with boils, associated with itching, burning, spreadiny and inflammation and gets necrosed. Now listen the symptoms of the deadly poison.

Wine posesses ten properties such as light, hot, sharp, finely entering, sour, quickly absorbed, quickacting, rough, depressent and non-slimy. (On the other hand ), ojas possesses ten properties of heavy, cold, soft, smooth, viscous, sweet, stable, clear, slimy and unctuous, Wine counteracts the properties of ojas by its own properties such as heaviness by lightness, coldness by hotness, sweetness by sourness, softness by sharpness, clarity by quick action, unctuousness by roughness, stability by quick absorption, smoothness by depressent action, sliminess by non-slimincss and viscosity by subtleness. ?Thus disturbing quickly the mind dependent on ojas produces narcosis, Heart is the seat of the channels of rasa, vata etc., psyche, intellect, scnses, self and primary ojas. Hence by excessive drinking and consequent damage of ojas thereby, heart as well as the dhatus located there get affected.

The enjoyment experienced in the first stage of intoxication in respect of five favourite senses by the youthful or the old is the unique in the world.

In alcoholism the treatment should be started of kapha because it is predominantly situated flanked by pitta and vata. The disorder which is caused by faulty, excessive or deficient drinking is pacified by wine itself taken in proper quantity. After digestion of dma and demerits of wine and arising of appetite and lightness, the patient should be given wine itself whatever is suitable to him, This should be cold with matuluiiga and fresh ginger, mixed with water and in proper quantity,[107][108][109][110][111] aqatiafaaaa daacsaatear | ATAATA Bat Farge: acai ara i RRR aragté at aomt sate rad aga | sama acai aera sara | LER UI are fe atfa anga afaarstoedien: | teustg wel a Aafia ae oem 1 ee I AAAESETAAET AA SATA: SAAT | MATA Hvar fa: HEH TAT | LL GMa gt qdimreceragafada: | ata maassiagiawe | fret i ete ti When sharp, hot, sour and burning wine is taken in excessive quantity the excited chyle is burnt and acquires alkaline character.

These added with the ten properties mentioned earlier become fourteen which reside in wine and because of this wine stands at the top of all the sour substances.
