In initial age, though the animals were sacrificable in yajfias ( sacrificial rites ), they were actually not sacrificed, but after the sacrifice performed by Daksa when sacrificial rites were performed by the son?s of Manu such as Narisyan, Nabhaga, Iksvaku, Nrga, Saryati etc. the animals began to be sacrificed with their (animal?s) own permission. Still later Prgadhra started sacrificing bulls when other animals were not available for his long term sacrificial rite. On seeing this the creatures became shocked and when in this afflicted mental state and consequent loss of agnithey ingested the killed bulls, it caused diarrhoea due to heaviness, hotness, unsuitability and use of inauspicious thing. Thus atisadra ( diarrhoea ) originated initially in the sacrificial rite of Prsadhra.
