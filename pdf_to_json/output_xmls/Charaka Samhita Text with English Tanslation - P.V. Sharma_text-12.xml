Such vata reaching the menses-carrying vessels in uterus takes along the blood and increases the quantity of menstrual flow thereby. The experts of the treatise named it as ?asrgdara? because menstrual flow is increased and discharged excessively. Thus cause and symptoms are said in gencral.</p><p>By differentiation, pradara is of four types?three by single cosas and the fourth one by sannipata. Hereafter I will describe their causes, symptoms and treatment. The menstrual discharge is frothy, thin, rough, blackish, reddish, stimulating water of palasa flowers with or without pain, there is intense pain in waist, groin, cardiac region, sides, back and pelvis. This is known as vatika type of pradara.</p><p>When pitta vitiated by ( intake of ) sour, hot, salty and alkaline things cause pradara in the above way, it is paittika. Listen about the symptoms.</p><p>If the menstrual discharge ?s bluish, yellow, very hot, black or deep red frequent and painful associate! with burning scnsation, redness, thirst, mental confusion, fever and giddiness, it is known as paittika pracdara. Further kaphaja will be said. Kapha vitiated by ( intake of) heavy things ctc. causes ( kaphaja ) pradara as above. Listen about its symptoms as they are.</p><p>Menstrual blood flows out as slimy, pale, heavy, unctuous, cold, and viscous with mild pain. This is associated with vomiting, anorcxia, nausea, dyspnoea and cough. Sannipatika asrgdara should be known which has the symptoms of all the three dosas.</p><p>When a woman exceedingly ill and anaemic indulges in all the etiological factors, intensely aggravated vata pushes out kapha with attenuated strength and burnt with the heat of pitta through the passage of blood (vagina) as foctid, slimy and yellow. When st carries away with force muscle-fat and fat and passes out constantly through vagina discharge simulating ghee, marrow and muscle-fat and she herself is anaemic, weak and associated with thurst, burning scnsation and fever, this is ( sannipatika and ) incurable. Whatever treatmant is prescribed for the types of the disorders of female genital track such as vatala ctc. should be given wholly in four types of pradara.</p><p>In pradara, the treatment as prescribed for raktatisara ( bloody diarrhoea ), raktapitta ( internal haemorrhage ) and raktarSa ( bleeding piles ) should be In vatika type of disorder there are abnormal taste, excessive froth and roughness. Due to pitta there are abnormal colour and foul smell and due to kapha there are unctuousness, slimincss and heaviness.</p><p>Vayu .vitiated by its vitiating factors such as ( intake of ) rough food etc. reaches the seat of milk ( breast ) and affects the taste of milk. So the milk affected with vata has abnormal taste. The child gets reduced while taking it, does not relish it and grows slowly.</p><p>Similarly the vitiated vayu churning the milk inside produces excessive froth and as such the breast milk flows out with difficulty. By taking it the child suffers from fecblencss of voice. retention of stool, urine and wind, or vatika head disorder or coryza. Vayu vitiated as above, dries up the unctuousness of the milk thus the child by taking the rough milk gets debilitated due to roughness.</p><p>Pitta vitiated by ( intake of ) hot etc. reaches the seat of milk and produces abnormal colour therein such as blue, yellow, black etc. the child suffers from abnormal complexion, perspiration, thirst, diarrhoea and constant fever and he does not welcome the breast.</p><p>Due to pitta vitiated as above, the milk gets foul order and the child taking is affected by anaemia and jaundice. Kapha vitiated by(intake of ) heavy etc. while reaching the seat of milk makes the milk too unctuous due to unctuous nature. By this the child suffers from vomiting, tenesmus, salivation and, due to channels being constantly smeared, is associated with sleep and exhuastion, dyspnoea and cough and excessive much discharge and feeling of darkness.</p><p>When kapha predominates and makes the breast milk slimy, the child taking it suffers from salivation, swelling of face and cyes and dullness. Kapha, duc to heaviness while reaching the seat of milk causes heaviness in milk. By taking such milk the child gets heart disease.</p><p>Other various respective disorders arise in the breast milk affected by vata etc. located in the seat of milk, In such cases, in order to purify the breast milk, first of all, the wet-nurse should be uncted and fomented properly and then treated with emesis. For this, XXX CHIKITSASTHANAM 527 she should be administered the decoction of nimba and patola salted and added with the paste of vaca, priyarigu, madhuyasti, madanaphala, kutaja and sarsapa. When vomited well, she should be given dict as prescribed and thereafter, considering morbidity, time and strength, she should be purged after having been uncted.</p><p>For this, she should be given trivrt or haritaki mixed with decoction of triphala or simply haritaki mixed with honey. When purged well she should be given proper dietitic regimen and then, for removing the remnant doga, suitable food and drinks.</p><p>In food, cercals of Sali and sastika rice, Syimzka, priyatigu, kodrava, barley and secds of bamboo and cane processedl with some uncting substance are beneficial. For vegetarian soup, green gram, lentils~ancl horse gram are useful, soups should be prepared with tender leaves of nimba and vetra, kulaka, vartaka and amalaka added with trikatu and rock salt. It purifies breast milk.</p><p>For non-vegetarians, meat of rabbits, grey partridge and deer should be given after processing them well.</p><p>For purifying breast-milk, one should administer water boiled with Sarhgesta, saptaparna bark and aSwagandha or simply with rohini.</p><p>Decoction of (1) gudtici and saptaparna bark, (2) Sunthi, (3) kiratatikta?these three mentioned in quarter verses should be taken for purifying breast milk. This is the general treatment of the defects of breast milk. Now listen about the other measures.</p><p>The woman having breast milk of abnormal taste should be given to drink draksa, madhuka, sdriva and payasya after they are pounded finely and dissolved in warm water. At the same time, the paste of paficakola and kulattha should be applied locally on breasts and when dried should be washed. Then milk should be taken out. Thus the milk gets purified.</p><p>The woman whose milk is excessively frothy should be given paste of patha, Sunthi, $arngesta and mirva with warm water. Besides, for purifying breast-milk, paste of afijana, sunthi, devadiru, bilva root and priyarigu should be applied on breasts as above.</p><p>One should prescribe for the wet-nurse the decoction of kiratatikta, Sunthi and gudiici to alleviate the defects of breast-milk. The breasts should also be applied with the paste of barley, wheat and mustard.</p><p>The woman having rough milk should take milk or ghee processed with galactodepurant drugs mentioned in the chapter on six hundred evacuatives ( Su, 4), 528 CARAKA-SAMHITA { CH.</p><p>As above, the warm paste of jivakadi pajicamula ( Ci. 1.1.44 ) should be applied on the breasts. It purifies breast-milk.</p><p>To remove abnormal colour from the milk, one should take paste of yas{imadhu, mrdvika, payasya and sindhuvarika with cold water. Paste of draks4 and madhuka should be applied on breasts and after it is dried the milk should be taken out To alleviate foul odour from breast milk onc should take the paste of visanika ajasrigi, triphala, haridra and vaca with cold water.</p><p>Or the wet-nurse should take powder of haritaki and trikatu with honey for alleviating foul olour from breast milk keeping on wholesome diet. The paste of sdriva, uSira, maNnjistha, glesmitaka, kucandana or patra, hribera, candana and usira should be applied on breasts.</p><p>The woman having unctuous milk gets her milk purified shortly by taking the paste of devadaru, musta and patha added with rock salt with warm water.</p><p>One having slimy milk should be advised to take decoction of sarngesta, haritaki, vaca, musta, sunthi and patha which purify the milk. She should also take takrarista mentioned as remedy for piles. She should also apply the paste of vidari, bilva and madhuka on breasts.</p><p>One having heavy milk should take decoction of trayamana, gudici, nimba, patola and triphala to remove the inpurities of breast milk. Or she should take ( decoction of ) pippalimula, cavya, citraka and gunthi, the paste of bala, Sunthi, §arngesta and miirva or préniparni and payasya should be applied on breasts.</p><p>Thus these eight defects of breast-milk have been said with their etiology, characters and treatment. Besides, disorders caused by the defects of milk have also been said. In the treatise of Agnivega redacted by Caraka seventeen chapters of this section, kalpa and siddhi sections were not available and as such Drdhabala, the son of Kapilabala, reconstructed these portions in order to make this treatise, full of great ideas, complete as it was originally, <ref type="bibr">[289]</ref><ref type="bibr">[290]</ref> thm aseqs ater agererera: | Aataza carers eter War | Ree 11</p><p>The diseases which are not mentioned here because of enormous extent of names and forms, for them also the above treatment is applicable with due consideration of flosa etc. <ref type="bibr">[ 291 ]</ref> at afeqrarat frat fed weg | setaert vata ala, werga arsafs 1 222 11</p><p>The measure contrary to dosa, digya ( pathogenic material ) and nidana Time relating to ( administration of ) drug is tenfold : ( 1-2 ) before meal day and night, (3-4) during mid-meal day and night, (5-6) after meals day and night, (7) frequently, ( 8 ) before and after meals, (9) mixed with meal, ( 10 ) Between morsels of food.</p><p>(1) In derangement of apiina drug should be taken before meals.</p><p>( 2) In derangement of samina it should be taken during mid-meal.</p><p>( 3) In derangement of vyana and?udina, drug should be taken after breakfast or lunch and meal ( or dinner ) respectively.

For these patients drug should be prescribed along with the items suitable to them because the suitable thing provides strength quickly and does not harm even if taken plentiful.
