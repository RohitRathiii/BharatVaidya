Again in the month of Magha or Phalguna (-late winter ) this powder should be impregnated 21 times with the juice of fresh dmalaka fruits, dried and powdered again. 2 kg. 560 gms. of this powder should be taken. Now the drug belonging to the groups vitaliser, bulk-promoting, galactogogue, semen-promoting and age-sustainers mentioned in the chapter on six hundred evacuatives (si. iv); and finely cut heartwood of sandal, aguru, dhava, tiniSa, khadira, SimSapa and asana and also of haritaki, bibhitaka, pippali, vacd, cavya, citraka and vidanga?All together should be taken in quantity of 2 kg. 560 gm. and boiled in ten times of water.</p><p>When one-tenth ( 2 litres 560 ml. ) remains, the decoction should be filtered well and added with the above powder of amalaka. Now this should be heated on cow-dung fire or the fire of bamboo chips or reed stalks till the liquid portion is -evaporated. This unburnt material should be collected and spreading on iron plates dried. When it is dried well it should be powdered finely with stone slabs on the deer-hide and stored carefully in an iron-vessel. This powder added with one-fourth quantity of iron powder ( bhasma ) and mixed with honey and ghee should be used according to the power of digestion. For a year one should live in the midst of cows on milk diet meditating on Savitri mantra, observing celibacy and controlling his sense organs. At the end of the year, he should fasst for three days and then should enter intoa forest of amalaki trees on full moon day of the month of Pausa, Magha or Phalguna <ref type="bibr">( winter )</ref>.</p><p>There climbing on one of the trees having big fruits should take the fruit situated on a branch by hand and wait for some time repeating the Brahman (om ) mantras till ?nectar comes in. During this period nectar positively resides in amalaka fruits which, due to presence of nectar, become sweet like sugar and honay, unctuous and soft. The person having regained youthfulness lives the number of thousands of years equal to that of fruits eaten. After getting saturated fully with them one becomes like god and Sri ( goddess of wealth ), vedas and personified knowledge attend to him themselves. <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> ( Thus is Kevalamalaka rasayana ).

This powder mixed with honey and juice of amalaka (fruits ) should be made into a linctus which should be kept in a ghee-uncted pitcher and stored for a year in granary of barley stirring it from all sides every month. After the end of the year, it should be taken mixed with honey and ghee every morning according to strength along with suitable diet after the drug is digested. This is the method of administration of all the metallic preparations.</p><p>One who uses the iron rasdyana, is not overcome by injury, diseases, senility and death because he possesses vital strength like that of elephant and exceedingly strong sense organs. The persons using the metallic rasayana for a year becomes intelligent, renowned orator, scholar and wealthy. By the same method, the use of gold or silver rasayana provides longevity and alleviates all diseases, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr">[23]</ref> ( Thus is the Lauhadi rasayana ).

Of them, éankhapuspi is specifically intellect-promoting. <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr">[31]</ref> ( Thus are the intellect-promoting rasdyana drugs ). One desirous of rasayana effect, should take pippali in numbers of five, seven, eight or ten with honey and ghee for a year. ( There is also another course such as ) three pippali fruits should be taken in the morning, after meal and before meal.</p><p>These fruits should first be impregnated with alkali of palaga and then fried in ghee.</p><p>These should be taken with honey by those who want rasayana effect particularly in order to alleviate cough, wasting, phthisis, dyspnoea, hiccup, throat disorders, piles, disorders of grahani, paleness, intermittent fever, disorders of voice, chronic rhinitis, swelling, gulma and vatabalasaka. <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> ( Thus is pippali-rasayana ). On the first day ten pippali fruits should be taken with milk. From the second day onwards upto the tenth day ten fruits should be increased daily.</p><p>From the eleventh day the number of fruits should be decreased gradually in the same order till it comes to ten ( on the nineteenth day ). After the drug is digested the person should take sastika rice with ghee extracted from milk. Thus the use of pippali in total number of one thousand is rasayana in effect. The pippali fruits should be taken by the persons with high strength in the form of paste, by those with medium strength in that of decoction and by those with low strength in the form of powder keeping in view the dosas and: the diseases. The initial use of ten pippali fruits is superior, that of six ones is medium and that of three fruits is inferior. These numbérs are also applicable according to the degree of strength of the patient. The rasayana use of pippali is bulk-promoting, beneficial for voice and life-span, alleviates spleen enlargement, sustains age and promotes intellect. <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> ( Thus is pippali-vardhamana rasayana ). Silajatu originates from four metals?gold, silver, copper and black iron and is slightly sour, astringent in taste, katu in vipaka and is moderate (neither too cold nor too hot ) in virya. This is rasayana in effect and if applied methodically it is aphrodisiac and alleviates diseases. Its potency enhances if it is impregnated with decoctions of drugs alleviating vata, pitta and kapha either singly or collectively. <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr">[50]</ref>  The impregnation is performed by dipping it in lukewarm decoction ol then taking it out at the end of the day, repeating this process for a week. Silajatu mixed with powdered metals should be taken with milk by the aforesaid method.</p><p>This formulation provides happy long life, alleviates old age and diseases, stabilises . the body, promotes intellect and memory and excellence if taken with milk diet. The : use ( of this rasayana ) is threefold?for seven weeks, three weeks and one week ~ regarded as superior, medium and inferior. The dose also is threefold?40 gms., 20 gms, and 10 gms. Now (I) will explain the specific characters according to the sourge and also the method of administration. The mountainous ores of gold etc. when heated by the sun excrete a material like lac, soft, smooth and clear. This is ( known as ) silajatu. Silajatu obtained from gold ore is sweet, slightly bitter, having colour like japa flower, pungent in vipaka and {ita virya. That obtained from silver ore is pungent, white, cold and madhura in vipaka. Silajatu obtained from copper. ore is like peacock?s neck, bitter, hot and katu-vipaka. ?That which is like gugguluka, bitter, slightly saline, katu-vipak and cold is the one obtained from iron ore and is the best of all. All types of silajatu smell like cow-urine and are applicable in all conditions. However, in the use of rasayana, the last one is preferred. ( As regards dogas ), the above types of silajatu are useful in vata-pitta, Kapha-pitta, kapha and tridogsa respectively. Horse gram, due to exceedingly contradictory nature, breaks the stones as seen in practice, that is why its use is contrain-dicated. Milk, buttermilk, meatsoup, vegetable soups, water, urine and various decoctions are used for dissolving -$ilajatu according to the object. There isno disease in the world which is not overcome by $ilajatu. It also provides great energy to the healthy person if used methodically and timely. <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr">[65]</ref> ( Thus Sildjatu rasayana ).

The rasayana formulations, aphrodisiac recipes and remedial measures for the diseeases?all depend on (a proper ) physician, Hence the wise should honour with all means the physician who promotes life, is wise and well-versed in the science ( of life ) as the king of gods honours Agwins.</p><p>Aéwins are regarded as physicians of gods and carriers of sacrifices. ( They have shown many miracles such as ) the head of the sacrifice was cut which was joined by them. The fallen teeth of Pusan, destroyed eyes of Bhaga and the spastic arms of Vajrin ( Indra ) were treated by them and thus he, addicted to soma drink, was again made happy. Cyavana, the descendent of Bhrgu, who was sensually indulged and became diseased, devoid of complexion and voice in old age, was reverted to youthful age. On account of these and other similar achievements, the two-excellerit physicians became highly adorable to the great selves like Indra etc. and vessels, praises, recitations, various food preparations, incences and animals are offered to them by the twice-born.. In. the morning, Indra enjoys the soma drink in company of ASwins and he also makes _ pleasure along with them in the Sautramani.sacrifice. Indra, Agni, and Afwins are worshipped mostly by the twice-born and are praised in vedic hymns, not so the other gods. Thus the twin physicians, A?wins, are worshipped carefully by the gods and their masters. Then how should the physicians not ?be honoured with all means by mortals who are afflicted with death, disease and senility and are after the search of happiness? ?The physician who is endowed with good conduct, wisdom and rationality, is thrice-born, well-versed. in scriptures and master of (the science of) life should be honoured as preceptor by the The treated patient, whether having promised or not, if does not offer any thing to the physician he is not freed ( from the debt). (On the other hand) the physician too should consider all his patients as his own sons, protect them sincerely from all the troubles, wishing the excellent piety. Ayurveda (the science of life ) has been enlightened by the great sages devoted to piety and wishing immortal positions for welfare ( of the people ) and not for earning or enjoyment. That who takes up the treatment only for human welfare and not for earning or enjoying exceeds all and those who sell the regimens of therapy for livelihood are devoted to the heap of dust leaving aside the store of gold. That who provides life to those being "dragged to the abode of death by severe diseases while cutting the death-nets can not be simulated with any other donor of virtue and wealth because there is no charity better than providing life. The physician who, considering compassion on beings as the highest virtue, proceeds in treatment of patients, accomplishes all ob jects and enjoys maximum happiness. The foremost aphrodisiac is the repository which is the exhilarating woman.</p><p>The favourite sense objects even singly are exceedingly pleasant what to be said of the female physique where they are stationed collectively ( the multitude of the sense objects is only in the female body not anywhere elsc ). Moreover, the sense object located in woman is more pleasure-giving, because there is special pleasure in women and the progeny too is dependent on woman. Virtue and wealth, affluence and creation also depend on women, The woman who is beautiful, youthful, endowed with auspicious features, submissive and trained is regarded as the best aphrodisiac. Duc to diversity in likings of the people and the fortune of women, the qualities like ood appearance etc. get enhanced on finding a suitable man. The woman who being excellent in terms of age, beauty, voice and amorous movements enters into the heart quickly due to fortune or other means, is like celebration of the heart, wets into the similar mind, possesses similar psyche, is submissive, pleases with his likings, is like a noose for all the senses due to her excellent qualitics, disjoined with whom onc feels restlessly the world as devoid of women, without whom the man holds the body as vacant of the senses, looking to whom one is not subdued with gricf, agitation, restlessness or fear; finding whom one gets solace and seeing whom exhilarates, whom one meets sexually ever as afresh due to exceeding impulse of sexual urge and even on frequent sexual intercourse with whom one does not get satisfied, is the best ?aphrodisiac for him. Men differ in their psychological behaviour. The healthy man desirous of progeny should go to the woman who belongs to dissimilar clan, is stimulating, exhilarated, free from mea ah and cleanly bathed ( after menses ). Sara ( roots ), iksu ( roots ), kandeksu, iksuvalika, gatavari, payasya, vidari, kantakarika, jivanti, Jivaka, meda, vira, rsabhaka, bala, rddhi, goksuraka, rasna, kapikacchi, punaranava?these drugs 120 gm. each mixed with 2.56 kg. of new black gram should be cooked in 10.24 litres of yater till one-fourth of it remains, Then paste of madhuka, draksa, phalgu, pippali, kapikaccht, madhika, and Satavari should be added to it along with the juice of vidari, dmalaka and iksu separately and ghee each 2.56 kg. and milk 10.24 litres.

This pindarasa ( solidified meat-soup ) is aphrodisiac, nourishing and strength-promoting and by the use of this one strengthened and sexually excited like a horse penetrates the penis fully ( into the female organ ). In the same way, pindarasa may be prepared from peacock, partridge and swan which promotes strength, complexion and voice and by the use of which the man behaves like a bull. <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr">[41]</ref> ( Thus the aphrodisiac pindarasas ).

This promotes strength. <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr">[45]</ref> ( Thus other aphrodisiac soups ). The white sastika rice fully sprinkled with milk and while wet should be pounded ina mortar and again impregnating it with. milk, the juice should be pressed out and filtered.

Likewise, the ,decoction of bald, mudgaparni, miasaparni, jivanti, jivaka, rddhi, rsabhaka, kakoli, goksura, madhuka, Satiivari, vidari, draksa, and kharjura should be added to the same. There after powders of vamfalocana, black gram, sali rice, sastika rice and wheat should be added so that the decoction gets solidified. Then by adding ample honey and sugar boluses may be prepared of the size of the jujube fruit and fried in ghee. This should be taken according to. power of digestion keeping on the diet of milk or meat-soup. By this even the old gets a large progeny and everlasting sex urge. One should collect the semen of sparrows, swans, cocks, pea-cocks, tortoises and crocodiles, cow-ghee, lard and the fat of kulifiga (a type of sparrow ), the powders of sastika rice and wheat; with these various dietary items like pupalika, Saskuli, vartiki, plipa, dhana etc. may be prepared.

Some get strength by time factor ( seasonal effect ), 2. some get it by practice, 3. some get it by other means ( aphrodisiacs ctc.), 4. while some are bulls by nature. Hence (1 ) will describe the formulations which provide strength to the weak, the same in the strong and are easy in administration. The physician, considering the strength, should administer the formulations for promoting semen and virility after cleansing the body by non-unctuous and unctuous enema. These enemas should be prepared with ghee, oil, meat-soup, milk, sugar and honey while the patient is kept on the dict of milk or meat-soup. Pounded fish meat added with asafoetida, rock salt and coriander should be mixed with wheat flour and cooked in ghee to make pupalikas.</p><p>Fishes?fatty, sour and salty?should be cooked in buffalos meat soup.</p><p>Then in the soup, meat should be mixed adding therewith black pepper, cumin, coriander, a little asafoetida and fresh ghee. This should be put within the pupalika prepared of black gram. . The above two preparations of piipalika are bulk-promoting, strengthening, providing exhilaration, charm and progeny and promoting semen profusely. <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr">[22]</ref> ( Thus two aphrodisiac pupalika preparations ). Whatever is sweet, unctuous, vitaliser, bulk-promoting, heavy and exhilarating is known as aphrodisiac, Hence one should trafick into women after having been replenished with such drugs, impelled by his own sex urge and exhilarated by the qualities of the woman, After sexual intercourse one should take bath and then go to slecp aficr taking milk or meat-soup, in this way his semen and strength are replenished. As fragrance is not_manifested in a flowerbud but the same is found after it blossoms, similarly is the semen. The man who wants full life-span should not trafick into women before the age of sixteen or after that of seventy. The man too young having immature dhatus dries up quickly like a pond with a little water if traficks into women. Likewise, the old man traficking into women shatters quickly like a wooden piece, dry, rough, wormeaten and rotten, on touch. Semen gets diminished by old age, anxiety, discases, reducing by evacuative measures, fasting and sexual indulgence. Even a saturated man does not get potency for sexual act due to wasting, fear, want of confidence, grief, finding fault with the woman, ignorant of the enjoyment with them, lack of determination and interest because potency is based on ( sexual ) exhilaration which again depends on the strength of body and mind, <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr">[45]</ref> carat aa aft afters fas aa adargnd 2% ga cera aarti 4% I ag Siqerant Ananewisas | TH seat eararssarsta wiz ui 2s I ewtaata aca afeseratcarata | aaa FaeaeATEaeT a II 22 Il aay Oat Zara: ys Zara ofasaa | acat feaaqe waged Azza | 4% I Semen is pervaded all over the sentient body like juice in sugar cane, ghec in curd and oil in sesamum ( seeds ).

[ 51 J. The reason for describing the formulations, the twelve excellent formulations, the entities to be used before and after coitus, the age when the women are not to be entertained, entire discussion on the nature of semen, derivative definition of ?Vajikarana??all this has been said in the quarter on a person strengthened , Again, by nature fever is related to the god of death and is known as ksaya ( wasting ), tamas (causing loss of conscionsness ), papma (sinful) and mrtyu ( causing death ) because it leads the person suffering from their own deeds to _ fiveness (death when only five mahabhitas remain bereft of the consciousness ).</p><p>Thus is said the prakti ( original source as well as nature of fever. In the sccond age ( treta yuga ) when Lord Siva was observing the vow o°w rathlessness (penance), the demons living on obstacles to penance, created mischeif for thousand divine years in order to put obstacles i ? the gr Daksa Prajipati ( Lord of Progeny ) though capable ignored even seeing all this.</p><p>Moreover, he did not give due.place to the offerings to Lord Siva in the sacrifice ( organised by him ) inspite of having been advised by the gods to do so.</p><p>Thus lic made the sacrifice devoid of the mantras relating to the Lord of animals and offerings pertaining to Lord Siva which were necessary for the success of the sacrifice, \Vhen afier completion of the vow, the god Rudra came to know the lackings of Daksa, he, the knower of the self, came into the wrathful state and by creating a ( third ) cyc in his forehead the potent one, reduced all these demons to ashes and created a boy, heated with the fire of anger, who could destroy the celebrations of the sacrifice. After this the sacrifice was destroyed, the gods were pained and the living beings afflicted with heat and pain were moving here and there in all directions. Then the congregation of gods along with the seven sages praised the omnipresent Lord with incantations till Lord Siva returned to his normal bencyolent state. Knowing that he is now in the benevolent mood the fire of wrath, which due to fear holds the weapon of ashes, possesses three heads, nine _cycs, is disturbed with burning flames, fierce and gradually has short legs and belly, submitted to the Lord with folded hands?Now, sir !what should I do for you ?</p><p>The Lord replied tohim??You willbe fever in the world during the birth and death and also in conditions of unwholesomengss.   The natural fever arisen in the seasons of Spring and autumn is easily curable.</p><p>Pitta, being hot itself, getsaggravated further by hot and is thus vitiated in the autumn, Likewise, kapha accumulated in the cold ( season ) gets aggravated in the spring.</p><p>In the rainy season, pitta is accumulated due to water and plants having amlavipaka ( acidity on digestion ) and the same being vitiated due to ( intense ) heat of the autumn gives rise to fever quickly. Here kapha associates as a subsidiary factor.</p><p>In such/ condition, there is no harm by fasting because of the uature of visarga The fever is termed as prakyta ( natural ) on the basis of prakrti ( nature ) of time but the vatika fever even a prakrta one is often troublesome. The fever arisen in seasons other than that responsible for vitiation of the concerned dosa is known as ?yaikrta? ( unnatural ) which is troublesome. Re in quick?acting it gets subsided or kills the patient by the period of seven, ten or twelve days. Dosa equal in respect of time, dtisya ( affected tissue ) and constitution and having no counter-acting factor causes the remittent fever and as such is quite unbearable. In remittent fever, asa rule, vata etc. also affect urine and faeces simultaneously as the dhatus. This fever gets subsided or becomes fatal in periods of a weck etc. according to condition whether rasa etc. have been purified completely o1not. When they are not purified completely or entirely the remittent fever gets lodged in the twelve entities (seven dhatus, three dosas, urine and faeces). Thus even after remission on twelfth day, it continues hidden for a long time In the fever caused by poisonous contact predominant symptoms are fainting, confusion, narcosis and malaise, In some cases, fever rises before the above symptoms appear while in other cases it comes forth after them or simultaneously with them.</p><p>The features of the fevers caused by passion etc. are also found in other diseases caused by them. ( In fact the above symptoms are psychosomatic ). On infliction of mind with passion etc, the fever does not get strength until the body is affected with vata etc. Similarly, on infliction of the body with vata etc., the fever does not get hold until the mind is affected with passion etc. The vitiated dosas, duals, aggregated or single, associate them with rasa dhatu while expelling the agni from its place and adding to the body-heat with their own heat and the heat of (displaced) agni, also blocking the channels spread all over the body with aggravation and thus produce pyrexia. The patient ts his entire body heated and thus is said as suffering from fever. Rea cals @ gana feat saz! ij . CHIKITSASTHANAM 67</p><p>After emesis and lightening the patient should be provided with gruels in time cooked with respective drugs starting with scum-grucl in the beginning till the fever comes down or for six days. By this agni is stimulated like fire by fuel.</p><p>Due to médication and lightness, they are appetiser, carminative for wind, urine, faeces and dosas; due to being hot and liquid they are diaphoretic; due to being liquid they alleviate thirst, due to being nutrient they provide strength; due to being laxative they produce lightness? and due to being suitable in fevers they act as antipyretic. Hence the wise physicians, from the very beginning, manage the cases of fever with gruels except in that caused by wine. Gruel is not advised in fever associated with alcoholism, alcoholic addicts, in summer, having predominance of pitta and kapha or with upward internal haemorrhage ( haemoptysis, epistaxis etc. ), <ref type="bibr">[149]</ref><ref type="bibr">[150]</ref><ref type="bibr">[151]</ref><ref type="bibr">[152]</ref><ref type="bibr">[153]</ref><ref type="bibr">[154]</ref> ae AURA sated MAT: 1 Uy </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[ 14 ] ( Thus is bhallatakaksaudra ) ASMARISIG TMISH ANQaa Keka gaa Kallas art Ta | 4 ( xfer agrerncte | )</figDesc></figure>
