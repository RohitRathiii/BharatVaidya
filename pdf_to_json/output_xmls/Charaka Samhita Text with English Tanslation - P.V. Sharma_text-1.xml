<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Vol. I of the Caraka Samhita was released in November 1981 at the inaugural session of the world Sanskrit Conference held at Varanasi. It is after about a year that vol. IT is coming out. During this period we were watching the response of scholars and readers towards the sudden appearance of this new edition of the Caraka Samhita. We are glad that it -has been very heartening and encouraging which prompted us to plan for further volumes of the great work. It is now contemplated, to prepare critical notes on the Samhita incorporating the views of main commentators and discussing them threadbare so as to bring out definite conclusions on various topics. As this would entail great deal of space and would practically be an independent work, a separate vol. IIT has been planned for this which is expected to follow soon.</p><p>Importance of the latter half of the Caraka Samhita Vol, II contains the last three sections ( Cikitsasthana, Kalpasthana and Siddhisthana ) of the Samhita. Caraka Samhita is predominantly a text on therapeutics and the author has excelled in describing the management of diseases system atically. That is why Caraka is regarded as the best one in the field of therapeutics??azaeg Fafsfae?. It is pertinent too because Caraka represents the school of medicine and his work is the embodiment of doctrines and traditions of therapeutics of this school. From this point of view, this volume is very important.</p><p>The Cikitsasthana ( section on therapeutics ) contains thirty chapters out of which the major portion (seventeen chapters) is ascribed to the authorship of Drdhabala. The other two sections ( Kalpasthana and Siddhisthana ) are entirely accre-dited to Drdhabala. Thus historically too, this portion is important.</p><p>The Cikitsasthana begins with the chapters on Rasdyana and Vajikarana which indicates the priority of prevention and promotion over treatment of disorders,</p><p>The other peculiarity of these two chapters is that it is reminiscent of the ancient style of dividing a chapter into four quarters (padas) as is seenin Panini?s astadhyayi and Patanjali?s mahabhasya. ) It is surprising that this style is seen in no other énd In. C29 chapter of the Samhita except that the matter of the Siitrasthana is divided into ?Catuskas? ( quadruples ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dirghanjivitiya vis-a-vis Ayurvedasamutthaniya</head><p>The extant Caraka Samhita begins.with the chapter on longevity. ( dirghaiijivitiya ) and the Cikitsathana begins with the chapter on rasayana which provides longevity. Thus both these chapters rclate to, more or less, the same topic. Secondly, the reporting of the deputation of sages to Lord Indra is seen in both the chapters though with slight variation. In the latter chapter Indra himself narrates the order of the advent of Ayurveda from Brahma onwards while in the former one the author ( redactor ? ) of the text gives it as introduction to the text. Moreover, in the former chapter Bharadwaja is sent to Indra as representative of the sages while in the latter one there is no mention of Bharadwaja and_ the sages themselves went to Indra in a group. The other material difference is that in Sitrasthana the sages have been shown as assembled because of the afflictions of the people to search remedies for the same but in Cikitssthina the sages having been unable to serve the people because of deterioration of their own healt happroached lord Indra who preached sermons of Ayurveda to them and also advised them to use the celestial rasayana drugs grown in Himalayas The narration of the Cikitsasthana seems to be more logical in view of the title of the chapter (1.4) while that of the Siitrasthana seems to be appended. later on ( most probably on the basis of the Susruta Samhita ) because Bharadwaja looks as a superfluous figure who has nowhere been mentioned again in the text. According to statement given in the Cikitsasthana, Atri himself was one of the members of the delegation and it is but natural that he taught his son Punarvasu Atreya, the science of Ayurveda. As the eight branches of Ayurveda were described not in the beginning of the text but at the end of the first section ( Sttrasthana ), the initial tradition of Ayurveda was traced in the last quarter of the first chapter of the Cikitsasthana and not in the beginning of the text.</p><p>According to Vagbhata ( A. S. Su. 1.7) Punarvasu Atreya himself approached Indra and taught Ayurveda to his son and other disciples. But, in my opinion, the statement recorded in the chapter of Rasdyana ( Ci. 1.4) looks genuine and rational and is also supported by KaSyapa?. The statement of Vagbhata may also be read as under :? men eqerssag «ae traferafaaed | RE ING 22s HOSE 2. em: efreraTel: Hearafrereageg:, 8 gaea: Aystery sag: | ( Ka, Vi. 1. 10) a ae, 7 @sPad a} acai asfa gafeert ale: | Asfiatanfesiet g@ gas aearfer Afats ( A. H. Su. 1. 3-4)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Portion redacted by Drdhabala</head><p>In Cikitsdsthana, from the third chapter onwards, therapeutic management of diseases starting from Jwara ( fever ) and ending with disorders of reproductive system is given. The description is in a very systematic manner consisting of definition, synonyms, types, etilogy, pathogenesis, prodromal symptoms, symptoms, prognosis, principles of treatment, drugs and their formulations, dietitic regimen and concluding remarks. The entire subject matter is dealt with in thirty chapters, out of these chapters which seventeen ones are ascribed to Drdhabala is a matter of controversy. The Bengal tradition follows the Cakrap4ni?s view,' while the Bombay tradition bs adopts a different course. What has been the basis of Cakrapani?s statement is also a matter of scrutiny but because it is confirmed by the quotations in Navanitaka and Jejjata?s statement? the above chapters may be taken as redacted by Caraka and the remaining ones by Drdhabala. However, one thing remains to be solved that in Nidanasthana ( Ch. 6 ). the title of the chapter is based on ?Sosa? while in Cikitsasthana (Ch, 8 ) the title is changed as ?Rajayaksma-Cikitsita?. This is the single instance out of the eight diseases discribed in Nidanasthana where change has been made, Is it casual or does it indicate change of redactorship ? Though nobody has pointed out this has to be considered. Kalpasthana contains pharmaceutical preparations of emetic and purgative drugs. In the introductory chapter there is general information about collection and storage of drugs and method of administration. In the concluding chapter again some general informations are given ending with units of weight. Entire matter is arranged in twelve chapters.</p><p>Siddhisthana describes the management of five evacuative measures ( Pafica Karma ) in details ending with a number of formulations for sustaining enema and tantrayuktis. This section is also completed in twelve chapters.  <ref type="bibr">_ 1982, pp. 623-627 )</ref>. However, some important ones are being mentioned here :? 1. In preparation of Bhallataka taila ( Ci. 1. 2. 15 ), the paste of madhuka has been said to be used in quantity of one aksa ( karsa=10 gm.) which looks negligible for the quantity (2 kg. 560 gm. ) of Bhallataka taila. Hence the present reading ?aeeareaata? ?has been replaced by ?@earsatata? 2. In treatment of gulma (Ci. 5. 76-77) there is no relevance of ?peya?.. Hence the present reading ?araeed qa HaqIwaa al? is incorrect and has been modified as ?gerateet: Yar Asaqaaa ay? 3. In ?arf gugi? the correct reading should be ?grat gug? because here the use of devadaru is intended and not that of Indravaruni ( see Cakrapani?s commentary ). ?gtrg? means devadaru while ?quer? would mean Indravaruni.</p><p>4. In ?gaia qrefrat faa, Beat 4 faearea fai aaearq? ( Ci. 6. 40 ) the word ?aararq? has no meaning because all drugs are to be decocted as such and there is no any reference of kalka (paste ). In fact, it should read as ?aaeary?-?valka? meaning ?Somavalka? which is a useful drugs for diabetes and already prescribed by Caraka ( Ci. 6. 38 ) 5. The word ?gia? in a formulation under the treatment of Kustha ( cu. 7. 111 ) is not clear. It should be ?aay? ( maRAN Bar wazit ) Ela has also been used by elsewhere in paste for kustha ( Ci. 7.84 ) 6. ?aftama qaequy? ( Ci. 7. 120 ) the word ?qz:? is irrelevant because there is no latex in kampillaka and only dusty hairs of the fruits of kampillaka are used.</p><p>Hence ?q:? should be replaced by ?ta?. Thus the correct reading should be ?arftqga Wwregeay? 7 7. The reading ?qdlaaiesizar: qagz? (Ci. 7. 123) has created great confusion even in minds of great commentators like Yogindra Nath Sen who interpreted ?qg-Qu? as sura ( wine ) produced ?by fermenting cooked cereals, but this is quite irrelevant because the present context is of raw drugs (plants ) and not of preparations.</p><p>Correctly the reading should be ?Hg? instead of ?qegu? which means ?gegzqygojy?</p><p>Cakrapani has rightly interpreted it as TNeanpay? presumably this confusion has taken place due to printing error, : 12. In ?geqeq quer: WIeIeagea ay ( Ci. 14. 43 ) the reading ?gsqeq? (meaning brick ) is quite irrelevant because here the context is to foment the piles with the bundle of certain vegetables. Hence the words ?ggmeq? has been replaced by ?\cqqieq? which seems to be more relevant.</p><p>13. Picchabasti in treatment of arga ends with the verse Ci. 14. 228. Thereafter there is one formulation of ?anuvasana sneha? ( Ci. 14. 229). Hence the concluding title ?gfe fasarafta:? should come after the verse 228 and not 229, 14, There are so many mistakes at the end of the chapter 14 of the Cikitsasthana : a) In verse 242, ?ghalsonf @ atsaq? should read as ?gnaeonfa @ alsa? b ) In verse 252, ?qxrezr? should read as ?aqgreat? c) In verse 253, ?fafa? should read as ?g fava? and ?Qeaqyq? as ?Yaysq? d ) In verse 254, ?searaaramera? should read as ?qsarzaramera?</p><p>One can easily justify these corrections if he goes carefully through the chapter and usage of words therein.</p><p>15. Water naturally flows to the lower side hence the reading ?eaarfararfeates? ( Ci. 15. 35 ) denotes quite contrary meaning. The correct version should be ?eayq@ farafiaree?</p><p>16. The reading ?stag? ( Ci. 15. 89 ) seems to be inappropriate because the context is of fruits and egetable. The correct reading should be? ?#tarra? (viii ) 17. In effects of Citrakadya gutika, the following verse is found? ufa wmgagea afeaca wa atl sa fara Aaaeag areaaqi ( Ci. 15. 97 ) Evidently, in the second line ?qt@aq? is a printing error which should read correctly as ?qpaqaq? 18. ?aga wave? (Ci. 15. 205) should read as ?a ga wasigd because the word ?aq? here qualifies ?qz:? 19. In colophon of the chapter on treatment of grahani disorders ( Ci, 15 ) the word ?gauilfafefiad should read as ?aeufalafafafiad?? on the basis of the title of the chapter. Jamnagar edition has repeated the mistake but Gangadhara has rightly corrected it. 20. In ?stfaar: tafe ava wafsaraa:? ( Ci. 17. 69) ?gee aaj? does not convey the relevant idea. It should read appropriatily as ?qq qafaaraa? 21. The concluding title ?gfa nacfamfegay? should read after the verse Ci. 17. 145 and not 146 because the context changes therein.</p><p>22. In Ci. 18. 87 the reading ?sfelarafay? looks quite incorrect because the herb ?Nil? or Nilini ( indigofera sp. ) has no ?sara? ( heartwood ). Cakrapani is also misled by this reading and thas interpreted it as ?afadinaart?? which is again not clear.</p><p>In fact, the present reading ?aetartfty facqeiy? should read as ?ale aiznfacaaiy?.</p><p>Varanapippali ( Gajapippali ) has also been used in this context elsewhere ( Ci. 18. 57 ).</p><p>23. In ?Hamas HeaAaeT eae: ci, 18. 101, the word ?Jivaka? is repeated which is not proper and as such the latter one has been replaced by ?Vrddhika?.</p><p>24. The word va¢ar%:? following ?cahagracaateararaga:? (Ci. 21. 86 ) should read as ?afepa.? because it is qualifying ?aga? 25. The verse ?ateurg eeej? ( Ci. 22. 11 ) is read separately and is interpreted by Cakrapani as general Samprapti of all the five types of Trgna. Here Cakrapani is wrong and the editor of the Nirnayasagar edition has been misled by him. After close scrutiny, the verse appears to be connected with vatika trspa and as such should read alongwith the following verse ( Ci. 22. 12). It may be noted that the general samprapti of the disease has already been said after etiology ( Ci. 22. 5-6 ). This is one of the instances of how Cakrapani himself has got confused in intrepreting the text and has been source of confusion for later authors. ff 26. Caraka has always used the verbal root ?ay? in Parasmaipada ( see <ref type="bibr">Ci. 22,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">20 etc.)</ref> and such the use of ?gea@? ( Ci. 22. 19 ) is not according to Caraka?s style. Hence it should read as ?qsafa?. 27. In ci. 22. 49, ?@eq? should read as ?Mem?. Similarly ?afta?? <ref type="bibr">( Ci,</ref><ref type="bibr">22. 51)</ref> should read as ?faaq?</p><p>28. ?qgaorsr:? ( Ci. 28. 9) should read as ?qea@reaar:? and ?sia? (Ci. 23.10-15) as ?Sina?</p><p>29. The sense of the verse Ci, 23.42 is that as wind spreads the fire blood spreads the poison in the body. The sense is not conveyed by the word ?faarare? which should read correctly as ?faqtenta? 30. In the context of skin disorders, ?faafaar? may be the appropriate reading for ?fagfasy ( Ci. 23. 84 ) 31. The insects have been said as of two categories?Disivisa and Pranahara ( Ci. 23. 140). After describing the symptoms of Disivisa type, those of Pranahara type are mentioned, Hence the reading ?qd\faaifga:? is incorrect and should be replaced by ?simgufga:?. This mistake has been committed by the editions of Chowkhambha and Jamnagar evidently on the basis of the Nirnayasagar edition. 32. Saale afeufie aed qaarnar? should read correctly as ?qaig alfeufie-?Heat q@araar which would mean that root of khadira, arista and: kutaja mixed with honey are to be taken with water. Here also Cakrapani got confused by the incorrect reading and as such was misled to give alternative interpretation??e@favar-ftemfa afzufte:, f&amp; a1 afeaasfie: 33. The reading ?ggzay? ( Ci. 23. 231 ) is incorrect because the context is of . raw drugs for making powder where sugarcane juice is quite irrelevant. Hence it should be corrected as ?gral? 34. ?aqq:? ( Ci. 23, 234 ) should be read as ?az:</p><p>Similarly TAOS PTGUaY? should read as HMSPAgray? 35. ?axe Syaaaeaay.? (Ci. 24.71) is not at all intelligible hence it should read as ?at ataaasfaerq?. Cakrapani also conveys the same idea. 36. ?faa waaay? should be read as ?Ara waar? because in the'present context three types of Apana ( Drinking party ) are described. Jamnagar and Gangadhara editions have corrected the mistake but the Chowkhamba edition has preserved it.</p><p>; &amp; 3 37. In Ci. 24. 159 ?aga geezq? should read as ?Saqvageneq? because ?leaves of NagakeSara? or tejapatra are not appropriate here.</p><p>Similarly, ?sagarai? ( Ci. 24. 162 ) is clearly a printing mistake and should be corrected as ?sawaral?. amnagar?and Chowkhamba edhions have maintained the mistake bu. Gangadhara has corrected it. 38. ?gvaat Qaonal a sara)? (Ci. 24. 41) should read as ?giqadaohal qe sara? because the former reading would mean two types of each godhana and ropana which is not the case. The actual idea is two types of kasaya-sodhana and ropana.</p><p>Similarly in the same verse, ?qa IgA? should be read as ?qazalea? 39. In six types of surgical measure, ?agai ( Ci. 25. 55 ) is clearly a printing error which should be corrected as ?@eai? 40. ?aaatfearai? ( Ci. 26. 67 ) is evidently a printing error and should be corrected as ?gaafearai? 41, ?qfamaoi and ?fearagfa:? ( Ci. 26. 121-122 ) are also printing errors, As the context is of the discharge from ears, these should read as ?qfaaani? and ?fearaela: | 42. ?gfa erfacazinfaaray? should come after the verse Ci. 26. 126 and not 127. 43, In ?emifaalfiad ae: Naat cama? (Ci. 26. 175) the word ?gqa}.? has been _ interpreted differently by commentators. Gangadhara takes it for Sannipataja. Possibly both are wrong because they tried to interpret an incorrect reading. Head diseases are of five types and as such leaving kaphaja and vataja there are three other types. Hence ?gyqa}:? in dual number could not have been used for the three -emaining types, it should have been ?gig?. Moreover, management of Sannipataja and krimija types has been described separately further in verses Ci. 183 and onwards, In my opinion, the correct reading should be ?gi@at:? which would mean cauterization and blood-letting in temples. This idea is also supported by Cakrapani.</p><p>44, The closing title ?gf ftitinfafscar? should come immediately after the verse Ci. 26, 180 and not after the following line.</p><p>45. The reading ?equeqaftaraar:? ( Ci. 36, 255 ) is again controversial. Gangadhara has left it totally, Jamnagar edition retains it with interpretation ?a bit of black pepper?. In my opinion, it does not look sound. The appropriate reading should be ?qaaaltan: aar.?-white pepper is a good drug for eye diseases and has been used by 16. ?ier agate waUTE aatzara? ( Ci, 26. 258 ) should read as ?alg ae-WUT amicaTs aiagary?. Thus they all would be uniformly connected with THT 47. Appropriate reading for ?guenaiy? ( Ci. 27. 29 ) should be ?avaa?? meaning exudation of salmali tree. This is also confirmed by Cakrapani, mination of semen, urine, faeces etc. This is based on the ideas of Suéruta ( Su. No. 1, 18 ) which might also be responsible for the modification of the Original reading ?aearfoy as ?areqey.? «49. Sat Pra aafeaar (Ci. 28. 41) seems to be denoting the condition of tongue in facial paralysis and not the adjective of Vak. Hence I have proposed the reading as ?yar frgr aafcanr? ( Tongue when protruded is crooked. ) version, Cakrapani got confused in interpretation and took both the disorders as one??naageafy eaeaea aq?. Vagbhata has named the former condition as ?eqeia? so as to diffentiate it from the latter ( axe or aqtaew ) 51. Similarly, In another verse ( Ci. 28. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr">[55]</ref> there is: deragement of lines, The reading as adopted by all the editions js? The commentators of the Chowkhamba edition take the first two lines as the description of qaq¥ and the following two lines as that of ?agfagt? while the Jamnagar edition, reaching near the correctness, takes the first three lines as the description of qaq¥y. The correct arrangement of the first three lines ( the last two lines are alright ) should be as follows :? ?adkatst ada fau: enafagnea a 1 eae area: wai afaot arata a | garsaeraaa fe at aeaeaaa @ 1? 52. ?sear eafeaaeaag? ( Ci. 28. 202 ) should read as ?mracalraaaay? 53, Discrepancy is also found in the arrangement of words in verses for nEIqaTe aa ( Gi. 29. 110-113). In the present edition, the closing title of the formulation is ?qarqay aa? but looking to the nomenclature of the next formulation as QUI ada? it should read correctly as ??qzrgarq tat. The second inference drawn is that as in @ESIHIaT aa the verses for aeiyqae da should begin with the word ?qqar?.</p><p>The confusion has arisen because the present edition has ? qqq? as the first word and so the name ?agiqqa? but it seems to be incorrect in face of the above facts. The proposed correct version of the first line should be ?qaa@lcqaagaqiehaagaraa:? instead of ?qq tae agTaTaala:?. ?, Cakrapani has adopted the incorrect version.</p><p>54. ?aliefagqaras:? ( Ci. 29. 140) should read as ?atzfagrqat @9:? so as to keep the word ?qq? free for joining with other drugs coming in the verse. 58. In ?fagnea feared @ aga aaar: mar? the reading ?qq}za? is incorrect, It should be ?aejz3? which is correctly adopted by Gangadhara. Other two editions have repeated the mistake. 59. ?aeaardt w32eY ( Ka. 12. 98 ) should read as ?apeqaygy aaa? 60. Here is an instance where all the commentators committed ?rrors due to incorrect reading. In wear g fata gzat at @ arfrar ( ka. 12, 93 ) ?Sea} gi should be replaced by ?a@qa} &amp;Y because it is the context of prasrta, kudava is already described above, Similarly, in the same verse ?qaj aay? should be read as ?Taga? 61, aeaa gaat aa: a afta: ( Si. 3. 32 ) should read as ?atag gaa St: q afta, 62. wraxne arg: qi ta: ( Si. 3. 32 ) should read as ?URINE greg: Wt eaq? T am fully conscious of the risk in putting up the above Proposals for correct and more appropriate alternative readings. I have also shown how even great commentators have mistaken because of following the incorrect readings blindly and not analysing them critically. The job was risky because I did not follow the prescribed procedure of consulting a number of manuscripts and depended solely on my insight and experience as G. J. Meulenbeld' pointed out. In fact, the errors were so apparent that they did not warrant a number of manuscripts to correct them in majority of cases. TI also did not considcr it wise to allow the errors to perpetuate. I am only hopeful that my suggestions might prove as a guideline for scholars working upon a critical editicn of the text of the Caraka Samhita. My object of this adventurous task is twofold?one, to draw the attention of the scholars towards urgent necessity of preparing a critical edition of the Caraka Samhita and two, -till such time, the samhitas should be read carefully and critically with open eyes not relying blindly upon various editions and commentaries. There is no last word in the realm of knowledge and I share the humble sentiments of Prof. Emmerick that there is always scope for improvement?, I am thankful to Prof. Filliozat for going through the work and sending his scholarly remarks. It is sad that he is no more to see this volume published. Cikitsita (that which alleviates disoraers ), vyadhihara ( destroyer of diseases ), pathya ( beneficial for the channels ), sadhana ( that which is instrument for performance ), ausadha ( that which is prepared of herbs ), prayagcitta ( expiation ), praSamana ( pacification ), prakrtisthdpana (that which helps recovery ), hita ( wholesome )?these are the synonyms of bhesaja ( therapeutics ), Thus the twofold promotive treatment for the healthy is said, As regards the measures for alleviating diseases, those will be described in the concerned chapters on therapeutics. The sole purpose of therapeutics is to alleviate. disorders.</p><p>Of them, the method of rasayana has been said first and thereafter the aphrodisiac measures. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> aveataf af faded attra aqaed fet q saga addres i t41 ?Abhegaja? is that which is contrary to therapy. This is to be avoided whereas the therapeutic measures to be descibed further are to be adopted. Haritaki possesses five rasas devoid of only saline taste, is hot, beneficial, carminative, light, appetiser, digestive, life-promoting, tonic, excellent sustainer of youthful age, alleviates all diseases and provides strength to all the sense organs.</p><p>It alleviates leprosy (including skin disorders), gulma, udavarta, phthisis, anaemia, narcosis, piles, disorders of grahami, chronic intermittent fever, heart disease, head disease, diarrhoea, anorexia, cough, prameha, hardness of bowels, spleen enlargement, acute abdominal disorders, excessive secretion of mucus, hoarseness of voice, disorders of complexion, jaundice, helminths, oedema, bronchial asthma, vomiting, impotency, lassitude in organs, various obstructions in-channels, plastering of heart and chest, impairment of memory and intellect in a short time.</p><p>( Those having indigestion, rough food, emaciated by indulgence in women, wine and poisonous substances and afflicted with hunger, thirst and heat should not use haritaki for long. ) Amalaki has the same properties and actions as haritaki, only the ng is contrary ( haritaki being hot while amalaki is cold ). Thus looking to these actions one should regard the fruits of haritaki as well as Amalaki like nectar. Five root pentads are taken in quantity of 400 gm. each ( pentad ) alongwith the fresh fruits of haritaki and dmalaki in number of one thousand and three thousand respectively. (The five pentads are as follows ) :+?Salaparni, brhati, préniparni, kantakari and gokgura constitute the vidarigandhadi group of five roots.</p><p>Similarly bilwa, agnimantha, syonaka, kaSmarya and patala constitute the bilwadi pentad of roots. Punarnava, mudgaparni, masaparni, bala and eranda constitute punarnavadi pentad. Jivaka, rsabhaka, meda, jivanti and fat@vari constitute jivakadi pentad, Roots of Sara, ikgu, darbha, kaga and ali constitute the Saradi péntad of roots?. These five pentads are taken together and boiled in ten times water. When water is reduced to one-tenth it is brought down and filtered.
