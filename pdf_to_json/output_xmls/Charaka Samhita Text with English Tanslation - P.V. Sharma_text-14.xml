Thus after listening very interesting propositions with arguments the wise son of Atri fully appreciated the discussion on the most important aimong fruits and said as follows??All have said well about merits and demerits of fruits but there is nothing which is devoid of demerits and merits and as such only the predominaiuce of merits is considered.

That is why it specifically acquired the title ?phala?in spite of existence of other fruits. After the teacher finished this discourse and it was acclaimed by the congrega-tion of sages, the group of disciples bowed with pleasure and submitted again as follows??O teacher; you told that enema, possessing all merits and performing all functions, does not go up beyond umbilical resion and moves only below it upto the anus then how sir ! does it eliminate impurities from the entire body ?</p><p>The teacher replied??This body is controlled by vayu through removing the retention and it alone or in combination of other dogas gets vitiated in its own location.

On this he pointed towards enema and when again requested described its method, O gentle ! for elephants and camels the urinary bladder of goat and sheep is used as cnema pouch. Similarly in cases of cow and horse buffalo?s urinary bladder and in those of voat and sheep old bulls? urinary bladder is recommended for the same by the experts.</p><p>In enema for clephant, camel, cow and horse, sheep and goat the nozzle should be one cubit, eighteen, sixteen and ten fingers long respectively and having ear in one-fourth part.</p><p>The dose of non-unctuous enema for goat and sheep is 640 ml. while for cow and horse it is double and triple respectively according to strength. For camels it is 5.2 litres and for elephant 10,24 litres, In case of unctuous enema, uncting substance should be one-eighth of the above dose. Indrayava, kustha, madhuka, pippali, vaca, fatahva, madanaphala, rasafijana, daSamila along with jaggery-and rock salt are useful for all variations are as follows:</p><p>For elephants, a §vattha, vata, a$vakarna, khadira, aragvadha, sila ( fruit ), salaparni, pr$niparni, dhava, sigru, patals, madhtkasara, nikumbha and citraka are additional drugs.</p><p>Decoction of palaga, bhiitika, devadaru and rohini is additional for cow.</p><p>Palaéa, danti, devadaru, kattrna and dravanti are additional drugs for horses. 666 CARAKA-SAMHITA [.CH. ???S??( Ce For asses and camels, pilu, karira, khadira and leaves of the plants of aragvadha and bilvadi groups are additional drugs.

The patient breathes with difficulty, has stiff and closed eyes, loses consciousness and groans like pigeon. This is known as ?apatantraka?. Causing fixed vision and unconsciousness it makes the patients groan. When the heart is freed he becomes normal and again gets unconsciousness when it ir covered.

If the head is not lowered the nasal drug doszs not reach the head and ( on the other hand ) if it is too lowered the same is stationed in the brain. Hence one should foment the head of the person lying in such position for proper evacuation. After fomenting, the nose should be raised up with the joint of the left thumb and with the right hand one should administer the nasal unction methodically through tube or tampon equally in both nostrils. Thereafter it should be fomented and the uncting substance with mucous should be drawn out frequently so that it does not stay. Kapha mainfesied during nasal therapy and excited by fomentation further sticks in the head ewes due to coldness of unction and thus gives rise to disorders in ear, carotid regions and throat etc. Hence one should smoke after the nasal therapy which may alleviate kapha. Moreover, he shouldtake wholesome diet, live in wind-free place, use hot things and keep control on his senses.The same method be applied for pressing.As regards blowing, one should blow up the powder with mouth through a tube six fingers long, When the head is evacuated the patient should drink hot water and thea should take food light and non-antagonistic for all the three dosas carefully and should live in wind-free place.If the evacuated person indulges in aggravating factors for any doa, it spreads there and produces numerous respective disorders.In diseases caused by untimely administration ( of therapy ) the wise physician should apply respective prescribed remedy accordingly.
