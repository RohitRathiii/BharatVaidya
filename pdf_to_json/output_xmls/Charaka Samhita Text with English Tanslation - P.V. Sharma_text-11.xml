Here uncting substances are used in four ways ( intake, massage, snuffing and enema ) and also sustaining enemas.</p><p>When prana is covered by samana disorders of grahani, sides and heart and pain in stomach are scen.

In such case enema etc. and carminative diet should be given.</p><p>When prana is covered by apana, mental confusion, diminution of digestive fire and diarrhoea are observed.

In such case ( the patient should be advised to take ) wholesome, measured and light food.</p><p>Thus five types of vata with mutual covering should be known fiom the ( above ) symptoms.</p><p>As a geneval observation, in the state of covering there occurs diminution or aggravation in normal function of these types of vata.</p><p>Thus the eight types of covering have been mentioned above broadly with If vyana is covered by pitta, there are burning sensation all over the body, exhaustion, restricted mouements of body, pyrexia and pain.</p><p>Heaviness in body, pain in all joints and bones, pronounced restriction of movements are the symptoms in vyana covered by kapha.</p><p>Deep yellow colour of urine and stool, heat in anus and penis, excessive menstrual discharge are the symptoms of apana covered by pitta. In apana covered by kapha, stool is passed as broken, associated with ama and kapha ( mucus ), and heavy and-there is also appearance of kaphaja meha. The learned physician take prana and udana covered by kapha and pitta as serious.</p><p>Particularly life is dependent on prana and so is strength on udana, Hence due to their affliction, there is loss of life and strength ( respectively ).</p><p>All of them if not diagnosed properly, continue for a year and neglected or managed improperly become incurable. In case of vata covered in all places one should administer immediately the carmination for vata with unctuous substances which do not block the channels but are cleanser of them and are not antagonistic to kapha and pitta.</p><p>Sustaining enemas mostly sweet ones along with unctuous enema should be applied but if pronounced strength is observed mild purgative should be given.</p><p>In these cases, the use of all rasayana formulations is commended such as the regular use of Silajatu or guggulu with milk.</p><p>Or the patient should use regularly the formulation delivered by Bhargava ( cyavanaprasa ) keeping on milk diet or the gleven formulations mentioned in the chapter on haritaki, amalaki etc. ( ci-1.1 ) should be used with wholesome dict.</p><p>If there is covering by apana, the entire remedy consists of appetising, astringent, carminative for wind and cleansing of bowels.</p><p>Thus the treatment of covered vatas prana etc. is said in brief physician should apply them after thinking himself.</p><p>In The one having less than all symptoms ?s maintainable while that which is free from complications is curable. Vayu having obstructed the passage of blood, enters into the joints: of extremities and covering mutually takes away life with pain.</p><p>In such case blood should be let out with horn, leech, needle, bottle-gourd, sacrifrying or venesection according to morbiditty and strength.</p><p>Blood should be taken out with leech from one suffering from distress, burning sensation, piercing pain and redness. One should take out blood from the patient having numbness, itching and prickly sensation with horns or bottlegourds. If the disorder is shifting from place to place, it should be eliminated by venesection or scarifying.</p><p>In case the part is reduced and the patient is rough and with predominance of vata, blood should not be let out.
