Lightening is not indicated in the fever caused by vata, exertion, injury and the chronic one. These cases should be managed with pacificatory measures. As the dosas, having thrown out the gastric fire and circulating along the rasa produce fever, the power of digestion diminishes. As even the inflamed fire inspite of fuel does not cook the rice well in ?cooking vessel because of being diverted outside due to wind, the digestive fire thrown out of its normal location by drsas in the patient of fever can not digest the food taken or digests light food with difficulty. Keeping this in view, the management with lightening etc, has been prescribed. Dogas entered into the seven dhatus get digested in the period of a week that is why the fever is said as mature on the eighth day. The patient having diminished agni and aggravated dogas is left suddenly by the vital breath or suffers for long if he takes food particularly some heavy one. Because of this reason the wise physician should not prescribe diet in:large quantity or excessively heavy or fatty from the start of the fever even in vatika fever. In vatika fever, if there is no association of any other dosa, massage etc. should be applied ignoring the usual procedure. Thereafter he should be given medicinal extract and then dict with meat-soup. Other measures efficacious in chronic fever should also be adopted. In patients who are consitutionally predominant in kapha and deficient in vata if fever comes with abundant kapha and low fever it does not mature even in a week due to mild agni. Hence he should be managed with the said lightening, light diet etc. till ten days and thereafter with medicinal extracts. which is:predominant in vata should be treated with ghee, enema?nonunctuous and unctuous?and fatty and hot food and drinks. That predominant in pitta should be treated with purgation, milk, medicated ghee, bitter and cold drugs. Visama jwara predominant in kapha should be treated with cmesis, digestives, rough dict, lightening measures, astringent and hot drugs. During remission of fever, the patient groans, vomits, moves, respires, becomes pale, has perspired organ, trembles, faints frequently, has delirium, whole body being hot or cold, becomes unconsious andj as if filled with anger during rise of fever, passes faeces with impurity and sound, liquid and with force. These should be taken as signs of the remission of fever.</p><p>In case the patient has profuse morbidity and the fever is acute and high, the remission occurs by crisis due to proper management and maturation of dosas.</p><p>On the other hand, if the -fever is chronic, the fever having risen due to ( aggravation of ) dosa gardually comes down. This is remission by lysis. If one takes these avoidable food and activities during convalescence before regaining normal strength, the fever relapses. It also relapses even with slight mis--Management in cases where temperature comes down though the dosas_ are not eliminated properly. That relapsed fever kills the patient suffering since long, debilitated and with poor agni ina short time. Some times dosas get matured in successive dhiatus, thus they do not produce fever but cause harm to the body. They produce anxious expression, swelling, malaise, palencss, anorexia, itching, rashes, pimples and mildness of appetite. Similarly, other treated disorders too relapse on a slight unwholesome activity if dosas are not eliminated properly. Hence even after the fever subsides, dosas should be eliminated or pacified according to condition, strength and vitality ( of the patient ). In such cases, evacuation with mild measures,? sustaining enemeas, light vegetable soup and meat-soups of the wild animals are wholesome.</p><p>Massage, anointing, bath, incense, collyrium, bitter ghee are prescribed in relapsed fever. If the fever relapses due to heavy, channel-blocking and unsuitable diet, management with lightening and hot therapy as mentioned above may be done.</p><p>Kiratatiktaka, kujaki, musta, parpataka and guditici?decoction of these drugs together, if taken regularly, destroys the r√©lapsing fever.
