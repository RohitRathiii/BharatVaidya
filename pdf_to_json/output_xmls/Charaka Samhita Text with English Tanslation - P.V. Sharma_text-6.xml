How does the solid flesh is originated from the liquid blood ? How is the origin of medas ( fat ) from the liquid blood and_ solid flesh ? How is there hardness in bones which are originated from the soft tissuesmuscle and fat ? How does the unctous and soft marrow arise within the hard bones? Sukra ( semen ) is said to be the: product of majja ( marrow ) but how does the semen pervading, the entire body comes out of the marrow situated inside the bone when there are no holes in the bone ? the teacher having been requested thus by the disciple answered as follows. &gt; Rasa, the essence of fiood, acquire redness from the colour of the firel-ike pitta. The same acted upon by vayu, ap and tejas and cooked further attains solidity and thus converts into flesh. It is further cooked by its own heat and being predominated by its own heit, ap and unctuous properties is converted into medas.</p><p>Further the innate heat combining prthivi, tejas, vayu etc. together gives rise 10 hardness and thus produces asthi ( bones ). Within the bones vayu creates hollowness which is filled up by the marrow, the esssnce of medas. From the essence of marrow, semen is produced. By vayu, jkaga etc. porousness is produced in bones through &amp; which semen comes out like water from the new earthen jar. Semen moves through its carrying vessels in the whole body and propelled with force from sexual ecstacyand passionate determination gets displaced and liguified like ghee by physical exertion | comes out of the urinary passage like water flowing towards the lower surface. The weak digestive fire burns the food incompletely which goes either upwards or downwards. When it moves out downwards either in ripe or unripe condition, it is known as the disorder of grahani. In such patients often the entire food is half burnt and the stool is frequent, constipated or liquid. There is presence of thirst, anorexia, abnormal taste in mouth, excessive salivation and feeling of darkness.</p><p>Besides, oedema on fect and hands, pain in bony joints, vomiting and fever are there.</p><p>Eructations have metallic or fleshy odour and bitter sour taste. The grahani disorder is caused by vata, pitta, kapha and all the three dosas jointly. Now listen their etidlogy, symptoms and treatment separately.</p></div>
